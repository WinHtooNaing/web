                <p><b>HTML</b> (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language
                     used to create the structure and content of web pages. It provides 
                     a set of tags (elements) that define the different elements on a webpage,
                      such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, tables, forms, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>HTML</b> is a foundational language for web development and is often used alongside CSS
                 (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create interactive and visually appealing websites.
                  It's important to follow HTML standards,
                 write valid code, and keep up with the latest HTML versions and specifications.

                <p><b>CSS</b> (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language
                     used to describe the presentation and appearance of a document written 
                     in HTML or XML. It allows you to control the visual aspects of web pages,
                      such as layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and more. CSS separates the content of a webpage from its presentation, 
                    making it easier to maintain and update the styling across multiple pages.

                <p>
                <b>CSS</b> is an essential skill for web developers as it complements
                     HTML and JavaScript in creating engaging and visually appealing 
                     websites. By mastering CSS, you can have precise control over the presentation 
                    layer and create customized designs that match your vision.
